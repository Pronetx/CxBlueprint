Main Menu (press 1, 2, or 9)
    ├─ 1 → Account Info → Thank You → Disconnect
    ├─ 2 → Support → Thank You → Disconnect (MERGE)
    ├─ 9 → Main Menu (LOOP BACK)
    ├─ NoMatchError → Retry → Main Menu (RETRY LOOP)
    └─ Timeout → Thank You → Disconnect (MERGE + ERROR PATH)

Key observations:
  • Main menu can loop back to itself (press 9)
  • Retry creates a small loop back to main menu
  • Thank You is a merge point (3 paths converge here)
  • Disconnect is the final merge point
  • One error path skips retry and goes straight to thank_you
